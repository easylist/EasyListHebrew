## How to Contribute to EasyListHebrew

### Missing a Filter or Found an Issue?

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the EasyListHebrew project. Whether you're adding new filters or addressing issues with existing ones, your support is valuable. Here's how you can contribute:

1.  **Understand Filter Syntax:** Familiarize yourself with the syntax of filter rules. Refer to the following resources for detailed information:

    -   [Basic Cheatsheet](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet)
    -   [Advanced Syntax](https://help.adblockplus.org/hc/en-us/articles/360062733293)
    -   [uBlock Advanced Features](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax)
2.  **Test Your Filters:** Add the new filter to your "my filters" section in your ad blocker and thoroughly test it to ensure it doesn't disrupt the functionality of the site.
3.  **Generate Checksum:** The list requires a checksum. To add it, make sure you have Python 3 installed, and run the [create.bat](create.bat) or [create.sh](create.sh) script on your machine.
